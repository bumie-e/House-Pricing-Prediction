# House-Pricing-Prediction
The objective of the challenge is to predict the price (Amount (Million Naira) the company should sell a car based on the available data (ID, Location, Amount (Million Naira), Bathroom, Bedroom, and Parking space. The objective is to predict the price.


### NB This work is an improved work of a publicly available notebook on Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/house-prices-prediction-using-tfdf

This notebook walks you through how to predict the price of a house, detailing data exploration, feature engineering, and model-building methods. Unlike regular machine learning workflows, we'll use Tensorflow to prepare, train, and make predictions.


Decision Forests are a family of tree-based models, including Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees. They are the best place to start when working with tabular data and will often outperform (or provide a strong baseline) before you begin experimenting with neural networks.
